<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm BaGoDevs</h1>

Welcome to my DevOps learning journey! This repository will be my comprehensive portfolio as I transition into the world of DevOps, starting from scratch. Here, I'll document every project I undertake, from foundational concepts to more advanced practices.

As an IT enthusiast with a hands-on approach, I'm eager to dive into DevOps. I believe that by sharing my journey from the very beginning, I can demonstrate that anyone can master DevOps, regardless of their starting point. This repository is designed to be a resource for both myself and others who are on a similar path.

I'll be following the [DevOps](https://roadmap.sh/devops) roadmap, tackling it step-by-step. Each section will focus on a specific area of DevOps, with detailed explanations, project examples, and key takeaways.
Objectives:

    Learn and Apply: Document my progress as I learn core DevOps concepts and technologies.
    Build a Portfolio: Create a solid portfolio showcasing my skills, making it easier for recruiters to see my capabilities.
    Continuous Improvement: Regularly update this repository with new insights, projects, and skills.
